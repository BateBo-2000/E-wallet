E-wallet
This is my thesis project.

I want to make online payment website.

It will include the following features:
-login/sign-in service
-administrator and user role system
-main menu with the user's balance, including buttons for other pages
-my account window with all the information about the user and options for changing it 
-currency tracker 
-a way to pay and receive payments with history
-statistics represented by tables and charts
-calendar with payment reminders
-budget manager made with carts and diagrams

I am planning to use 3 layer architecture:
-database - MySQL workbench
-backend - JS, typescript
-frontend - html/css, JS

The backend will be divided on 3 layers: 
1st - the connection to the database
2nd - the actual backend
3rd - the connections to the frontend
