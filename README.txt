Welcome to the E-Wallet project! This is a E-Wallet application with two main components: a client and a server. 
Please follow the instructions below to get started.

Prerequisites
   Before you can run the E-Wallet project, you'll need to have the following installed on your system:
      -Node.js (https://nodejs.org/en/download/)
      -MySQL Server (https://dev.mysql.com/downloads/mysql/)

Project Structure
   The E-Wallet project is organized into the following directories:
      -client: Contains the front-end client code
      -server: Contains the back-end server code
      -sql: Contains the SQL files for setting up the database
      -Database Setup

To set up the database, follow these steps:
   -Start your MySQL Server.
   -Import the SQL files from the sql folder into your MySQL Server to create the necessary tables and schema.
   -Running the Server

To run the server, follow these steps:
   -Open your terminal or command prompt.
   -Navigate to the project's server folder using cd server.
   -Run npm install to install all the required dependencies.
   -Run npm start to start the server. You should see a message indicating that the server is running and the port it is listening on.
   -Running the Client

To run the client, follow these steps:
   -Open another terminal or command prompt.
   -Navigate to the project's client folder using cd client.
   -Run npm install to install all the required dependencies.
   -Run npm run start to start the client. Your default web browser should automatically open, displaying the E-Wallet application.

Now you should have both the server and client up and running. Enjoy using the E-Wallet application!
