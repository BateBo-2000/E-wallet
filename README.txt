E-wallet
This is my thesis project.

The project is an abstraction of a bank account where you can (like in steam) add money and use/withdraw them. 
The money will be in other bank account (not owned by you) - stripe(for now). 

It will include the following features:
-login/sign-in service
-administrator and user role system
-main menu with the user's balance, including buttons for other pages
-'my account' window with all the information about the user and options for changing it 
-currency tracker 
-a way to pay and receive payments with history
-statistics represented by tables and charts
-reminders

The project is made with the following technologies:
-database - MySQL workbench
-backend - JS, npm, express.js
-frontend - html/css, JS, React

The backend will be divided on 3 layers according to the mvc model.
